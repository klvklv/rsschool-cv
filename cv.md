## About Me
I'm scared to death and just trying to survive. If I fail to master the frontend, I'll have to work as a cleaner. This fact  motivate me strong, but it does not add confidence in luck. I understand that I have to write in this section something correct from the point of view of the HR. But I write the truth. Nobody will read it anyway.
